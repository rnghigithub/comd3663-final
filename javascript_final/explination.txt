Intro
So my Java final i choose to create a MTA commute map on Canvas2d. In order to create this I had first implemented the canvas opening/closing tag in my index.html file in order to set the width & height of the canvas that I will be drawing on. In this case i set it to 1024px by 720px, w/o setting these dimensions; in any of the code files, nothing will show in the browser. 

Setting the Variables 
Now in the main.js file the first thing that needs to be done is to declare the function draw(). This will allow us to create or draw on the canvas we made in the index.html. Inside the constructors of function draw (){} I declare/initialize my variables of const canvas and let ctx. For const canvas, the variable cannot be reassigned and comes from the index.html id of canvas by the getElementById() method. The HTML DOM allows for this to occur. For let ctx (shorthand for context) I am declaring/initializes a variable that can be reassigned. Then i pass the value of the 
.getContext('2d') method with the canvas variable. 

Checking For Browser Support of Canvas2d
After declaring and initializing these variables, I need to check for if canvas is supported in the browser. To do this I would create an if/else statement. To break it down we declare if (canvas.getContext) is allowed then the browser allows for canvas2d. If else than we declare/initialize a value of para with the value of document.querySelector('unsupported'). This means that the element is queried through the p tag, para variable with a class name of .unsupported. Next we set the .textContent property to the para variable passed with the variable of 'Browser unsupported for HTML5 Canvas' as a template literal aka a sting literal expression. The value passed will show on the browser if canvas2d is not supported. 

Explaining How the Illustration was Made 
The rectangles were made using the fillRect() and strokeRect() method. 
The syntax for fillRect (x, y, width , height)
